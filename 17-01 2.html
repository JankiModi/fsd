<p>It's been a long day without you, my friend
    And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
    We've come a long way from where we began
    Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
    When I see you again
    Damn, who knew?
    All the planes we flew, good things we been through
    That I'd be standing right here talking to you
    'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
    But something told me that it wouldn't last
    Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
    Those were the days, hard work forever pays
    Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
    Uh
    How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
    Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
    And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
    It's been a long day without you, my friend
    And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
    We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
    From where we began (you know we started)
    Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
    When I see you again
    First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
    And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
    And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
    (The love will never get lost)
    And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
    Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
    And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
    (Remember me when I'm gone)
    How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
    Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
    And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
    So let the light guide your way, yeah
    Hold every memory as you go
    And every road you take
    Will always lead you home, home
    It's been a long day without you, my friend
    And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
    We've come a long way from where we began

        <p>I love it when you call me señorita
            I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
            But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
            It's true, la-la-la
            Ooh, I should be running
            Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
            Land in Miami
            The air was hot from summer rain
            Sweat dripping off me
            Before I even knew her name, la-la-la
            It felt like ooh, la-la-la
            Yeah, no
            Sapphire moonlight
            We danced for hours in the sand
            Tequila sunrise
            Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
            It felt like ooh, la-la-la, yeah
            I love it when you call me señorita
            I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya

            It's true, la-la-la
            Ooh, I should be running
            Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
            I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
            But every touch is ooh, la-la-la

            Ooh, I should be running
            Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
            Locked in the hotel
            There's just some things that never change
            You say we're just friends
            But friends don't know the way you taste, la-la-la
            'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
            Don't you let me fall, oh
            Ooh, when your lips undress me
            Hooked on your tongue
            Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly
            Don't stop
            I love it when you call me señorita
            I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
            But every touch is ooh, la-la-la

            But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
            It's true, la-la-la (true, la-la)
            Ooh, I should be running
            Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
            All along I've been coming for ya (for ya)
            And I hope it meant something to ya (ooh)
            Call my name, I'll be coming for ya
            Coming for ya, coming for ya, coming for ya
            For ya
            For ya (oh, she loves it when I call)
